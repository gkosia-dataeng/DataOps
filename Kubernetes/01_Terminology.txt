Kubernetes: used to manage containerized applications

    Control plane: manage the state of the cluster

        API Server:      front-end, handle request and store data in etcd database
        etcd database:   distributed key-value store for configuration data
        Control Manager: running controllers that regulate the state of the cluster
        Scheduler:       assign new workloads to nodes based on available resources


    Data Plane: consists of nodes which acts as workers for the containerized apps

        Main node components:
            kubelet: responsible for managingf the state of the node (start, stop and maintain the containers on the node)
            kube-proxy: responsible for communication between services and pods 
            Container runtime: pulling the container images from registry and running them


Kubernetes resources:

    Deployment:  a specific number of pods is always running in the cluster
                 resource limits and requests for the pods can be defined
    Service:     used to expose an application outdside of the cluster
                 Depending of the type of the service the cluster will route the incoming traffic to specific NodePort
    StatefulSet: Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods
    
    PersistentVolumeClaim: used to provide persistent storage even in case of pod deletion or restart

    ConfigMaps: used to map scripts outside of the image
                use to run environment configuration commands
